Title:
Bahrain Import Data (2020 - 2024) "Iron & Steel" 

Problem Statement: 
Between 2020 and 2024, Bahrain imported various Iron and Steel products from multiple countries. Some of these commodities are 100% dependent on a single country for imports. This dependency creates a high supply risk ,when all imports come from one country, any change in that countryâ€™s export activity can lead to shortages, increase costs, and limited supply of Iron and Steel in Bahrain.


 Insights and Findings:
 1- Increasing local production over the year. 
 2- The most frequently imported commodities from the Arabian Gulf countries.
 3- Some commodities are heavily dependent on a single country. 


Recommendations: 
1- Diversify Suppliers.
2- Increasing local productivity.
3- Consider long-term contracts to reduce volatility.
